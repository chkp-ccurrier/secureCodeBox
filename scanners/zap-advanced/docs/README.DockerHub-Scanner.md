## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://docs.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://docs.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `3.0.0`, `2.9.0`, `2.8.0`, `2.7.0`

## How to use this image
This `scanner` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding `parser` image to parse the scanner `findings` to generic secureCodeBox results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/ZAP].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/scanner-zap-advanced
```

## What is OWASP ZAP?

The [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)][zap owasp project] is one of the world’s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers*. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. It's also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

To learn more about the ZAP scanner itself visit [https://www.zaproxy.org/](https://www.zaproxy.org/).

## Scanner Configuration

Listed below are the arguments supported by the `zap-advanced-scan` script.

The command line interface can be used to easily run server scans: `-t www.example.com`

```bash
usage: zap-client [-h] -z ZAP_URL [-a API_KEY] [-c CONFIG_FOLDER] -t TARGET [-o OUTPUT_FOLDER] [-r {XML,JSON,HTML,MD}]

OWASP secureCodeBox OWASP ZAP Client  (can be used to automate OWASP ZAP instances based on YAML configuration files.)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -z ZAP_URL, --zap-url ZAP_URL
                        The ZAP API Url used to call the ZAP API.
  -a API_KEY, --api-key API_KEY
                        The ZAP API Key used to call the ZAP API.
  -c CONFIG_FOLDER, --config-folder CONFIG_FOLDER
                        The path to a local folder containing the additional ZAP configuration YAMLs used to configure OWASP ZAP.
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        The target to scan with OWASP ZAP.
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        The path to a local folder used to store the output files, eg. the ZAP Report or logfiles.
  -r {XML,JSON,HTML,MD}, --report-type {XML,JSON,HTML,MD}
                        The OWASP ZAP Report Type.
